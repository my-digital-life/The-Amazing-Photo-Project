# The-Amazing-Photo-Project
Trying to use Immich to sort out and clean up the 20–30k photos I’ve collected over the years. This is the start of that whole adventure. No idea where it’ll end up, but it feels like the right time to dive in.
If you’re not into AI, this probably isn’t your place — I’m using Copilot to help me work through the details and keep things organized.
